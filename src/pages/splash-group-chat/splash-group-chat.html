        <p>TERMS OF USE Welcome to FET.XXX, operated by JUSTAPPS.IO (“us,” “we,” the “Company” or “FET.XXX”).
          <br>
          <p class="terms_of">
            1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement. By creating a FET.XXX account or by using the FET.XXX iMessage app (“FET.XXX"),
            whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be
            bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy and Safety Tips, each of which is incorporated by reference
            into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features,
            products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree
            to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service. We may make changes to this
            Agreement and to the Services from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect
            changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version
            of this Agreement will be posted on the Services under Settings and also on FET.XXX.com, and you should regularly
            check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include
            material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable
            means, which could include notification through the Services or via email. If you continue to use the Services
            after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.
            <br>
            <br> 2. Eligibility. You must be at least 18+ years of age to create an account on FET.XXX and use the Service. By
            creating an account and using the Service, you represent and warrant that: you can form a binding contract with
            FET.XXX, you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of your Country or any other
            applicable jurisdiction–meaning., you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national
            and international laws, rules and regulations, and you have never been convicted of a felony and that you are
            not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.
            <br>
            <br>3. Your Account. In order to use FET.XXX, in the future you may sign in using your Facebook login. If you do
            so, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not limited to your
            public Facebook profile and information about Facebook friends you share in common with other FET.XXX users.
            For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy
            Policy. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up
            for FET.XXX, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think
            someone has gained access to your account, please immediately contact help@FET.XXX.
            <br>
            <br>4. FET.XXX Messaging. FET.XXX Messaging is an iMessage app that allows users to have a FET.XXX-like experience
            outside of FET.XXX. Through FET.XXX Messaging, you can select photos from your mobile device to create your own
            card stack to share with your contacts. Contacts who have FET.XXX Messaging will be able to vote on the photos
            by swiping right, swiping left or using the voting buttons. FET.XXX Messaging operates separately from the main
            FET.XXX experience, so when you use FET.XXX Messaging, you aren’t creating an account, logging in with Facebook,
            sharing your Facebook details with us or creating a profile that will be shown on FET.XXX.
            <br>
            <br>5. Modifying the Services and Termination. FET.XXX is always striving to improve the Services and bring you additional
            functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements
            from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights
            or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Services entirely,
            in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns,
            prevent us from doing so. You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions
            in “Settings” in the Service, however you will need to manage your in app purchases through your mobile device
            platform (e.g., iTunes, Google Play). FET.XXX may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes
            that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases.
            After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still
            apply to you and FET.XXX: Section 5, Section 6, and Sections 13 through 20.
            <br>
            <br>6. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Users. Though FET.XXX strives to encourage a respectful user experience
            through features like the double opt-in that only allows users to communicate if they have both indicated interest
            in one another, it is not responsible for the conduct of any user on or off of the Services. You agree to use
            caution in all interactions with other users, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet
            in person. In addition, you agree to review and follow FET.XXX’s Safety Tips, located on FET.XXX, prior to using
            the Service. You should not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card or bank account
            information), or wire or otherwise send money, to other users. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS
            WITH OTHER USERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT FET.XXX DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE
            INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. FET.XXX MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF
            USERS. FET.XXX RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER
            REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS.

            <br>
            <br>8. Rights you Grant FET.XXX. By creating an account, you grant to FET.XXX a worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable,
            royalty-free, right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and
            distribute information you authorize us to access from Facebook, as well as any information you post, upload,
            display or otherwise make available (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to other users (collectively,
            “Content”). Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding
            personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by those laws) and
            is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and

            who may receive shared Content from other FET.XXX users). You agree that all information that you submit upon

            in whole or in part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the reputation of the Service.
            When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. If we feel that
            your behavior towards any of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening
            or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account. In consideration for FET.XXX allowing

            <br>
            <br>11. Purchases. In App Purchases. From time to time, FET.XXX may offer products and services for purchase (“in
            app purchases”) through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by FET.XXX (each, a “Software
            Store”). If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with
            your Software Store (“your IAP Account”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance
            with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that
            apply to your IAP Account. Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you
            purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed
            continuously for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again
            after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent
            period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically,
            or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow
            instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have
            deleted the FET.XXX application from your device. Deleting your account on FET.XXX or deleting the FET.XXX application
            from your device does not cancel your subscription; FET.XXX will retain all funds charged to your IAP Account
            until you cancel your subscription through your IAP Account. FET.XXX Online Purchases. If you choose to make
            a purchase through FET.XXX Online, you agree to pay FET.XXX all charges at the prices displayed to you for the
            services you’ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and you
            authorize FET.XXX to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). FET.XXX may correct any billing
            errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback
            or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, FET.XXX may terminate your account immediately
            in its sole discretion. If you purchase a subscription through FET.XXX Online, your subscription will continue
            indefinitely until cancelled by you. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent
            subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the
            price you agreed to when subscribing, until you cancel. You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic
            renewal feature. If you do not wish your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate
            your subscription, please log in and go to “My Profile” on FET.XXX Online and follow the instructions. If you
            cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term,
            and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. You may edit your Payment Method
            information by visiting FET.XXX Online and going to “My Profile.” If a payment is not successfully settled, due
            to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel
            your subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the
            Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. In addition,
            you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit
            card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment
            Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other
            provider of your chosen Payment Method. If you reside outside of the Americas, you agree that your payment to
            FET.XXX will be through MTCH Technology Services Limited. Gifting and Other Virtual Items. From time to time,
            you may be able to purchase, with “real world” money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
            revocable license to use “virtual items,” including but not limited to Gifting (collectively, “Virtual Items”).
            You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service and not
            in any other way. Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement. Except as otherwise
            prohibited by applicable law, Virtual Items obtained by you are licensed to you, and you acknowledge that no
            title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned to you. This Agreement should not
            be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items. Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not
            constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent
            of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in Virtual
            Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, when FET.XXX ceases providing the Service
            or your account is otherwise closed or terminated. FET.XXX, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge
            fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and/ or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge.
            FET.XXX may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time. FET.XXX shall have no liability
            to you or any third party in the event that FET.XXX exercises any such rights. The transfer of Virtual Items
            is prohibited, and you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity. Virtual
            Items may only be redeemed through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE
            SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service provided
            by FET.XXX that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such Virtual Items. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
            THAT FET.XXX IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER
            COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
            Refunds. Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially
            used periods. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested within fourteen days
            of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds. For subscribers
            residing in the EU or European Economic Area, in accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund
            during the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription
            starts. For FET.XXX Plus subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,
            New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, the terms below apply: You may cancel your subscription, without
            penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed.
            In the event that you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund
            of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your
            death. In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of FET.XXX) before
            the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had
            made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing the company notice
            in the same manner as you request a refund as described below. Purchases of Virtual Items are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.
            To request a refund: If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not FET.XXX. To request
            a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit “Report
            Problem”. You can also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com. If you subscribed using your Google
            Play Store account or through FET.XXX Online: please contact customer support with your order number for the
            Google Play Store (you can find the order number in the order confirmation email or by logging in to Google Wallet)
            or FET.XXX Online (you can find this on your confirmation email). You may also mail or deliver a signed and dated
            notice which states that you, the buyer, are canceling this agreement, or words of similar effect. Please also
            include the email address or telephone number associated with your account along with your order number. This
            notice shall be sent to: cancel@FET.XXX.

            behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been
            infringed; a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service (and such
            description must be reasonably sufficient to enable us to find the alleged infringing material); your contact
            information, including address, telephone number and email address; a written statement by you that you have
            a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

            <br>14. Third Party Services. The Service may contain advertisements and promotions offered by third parties and
            links to other web sites or resources. FET.XXX is not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability)
            of such external websites or resources. If you choose to interact with the third parties made available through

            for such third parties’ terms or actions.
            <br>
            <br>15. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL FET.XXX, ITS
            AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,

            ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO FET.XXX FOR THE SERVICE WHILE YOU
            HAVE AN ACCOUNT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL
            OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
            <br>
            <br>16. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver. Except for users residing within the EU or European Economic
            Area and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law: The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim
            arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING
            ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association under the Consumer Arbitration Rules. The one
            exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the
            Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims
            court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration,
            or other representative action or proceeding. By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration
            agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and
            the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE
            IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE
            OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled
            to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should
            note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
            Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
            For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration
            agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any
            court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable,
            any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal
            or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those
            courts for such purposes. This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the
            laws of the state of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement
            shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission
            is available under http://ec.europa.eu/odr. FET.XXX does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front
            of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area.
            <br>
            <br>17. Governing Law. For users residing in the EU or European Economic Area or elsewhere where our arbitration
            agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Texas, U.S.A., excluding Texas’s conflict of laws rules, will apply
            to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the
            choice of Texas governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.
            <br>
            <br>18. Venue. Except for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area, who may bring claims in their country
            of residence in accordance with applicable law, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
            Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A., and you
            and FET.XXX consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
            <br>
            <br> 19. Indemnity by You. You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold
            harmless FET.XXX, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from
            and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including
            attorney’s fees, due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, your
            Content, or your breach of this Agreement.
            <br>
            <br>20. Entire Agreement; Other. This Agreement, with the Privacy Policy, the Safety Tips and any terms disclosed
            and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service, contains
            the entire agreement between you and FET.XXX regarding the use of the Service. If any provision of this Agreement
            is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the
            Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
            right or provision. You agree that your FET.XXX account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your account
            and its Content terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment is created as
            a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations or bind FET.XXX in any manner.
